# SkillBridge ðŸš€

*Making job hunting less terrible, one skill at a time*

## What's This About?

Hey there! We're **Mind Over Mattress** - a bunch of university friends who got tired of seeing our classmates struggle with finding jobs that actually match their skills. So we decided to build something about it instead of just complaining.

SkillBridge is our attempt at creating a smarter job-skill matching platform that doesn't suck. Think of it as if LinkedIn and Duolingo had a baby, but actually useful for the Indian job market.

## The Team ðŸ‘¥

- **Pranav Rana** - Lead AI Engineer (makes machines think, sometimes better than us)
- **Pratyush Rawat** - ML Research Specialist (turns data into insights and coffee into code)
- **Pratyush Shankar** - Blockchain & API Development (builds the pipes that connect everything securely)
- **Nihal** - Full Stack & Integration (keeps everything running while we break stuff)

## What We're Planning to Build

### The Core Ideas:
- **AI-Powered Skill Assessments** - No more generic "rate yourself 1-10" nonsense
- **Smart Job Matching** - Actually understands what you're good at
- **Personalized Learning Paths** - Because everyone learns differently
- **Multilingual Support** - 22 Indian languages (our parents will be proud)

### The Ambitious Stuff:
- **Computer Vision Integration** - Video-based skill demos
- **Blockchain Credentials** - Tamper-proof certificates
- **Gamification** - Making learning addictive (in a good way)
- **Rural Employment Network** - Bridging the urban-rural divide

## Tech Stack

```
Frontend: React.js (because we're basic like that)
Backend: Python (Pranav's favorite)
AI/ML: All the fancy stuff Pratyush R. knows
Database: PostgreSQL (reliable and boring)
Blockchain: Whatever Pratyush S. thinks is cool this week
APIs: Video calling and other integrations
```

## Why This Matters

The Indian job market is kinda broken:
- 65% skill-job mismatch (that's a lot of unhappy people)
- High unemployment among educated youth
- Rural areas getting left behind

We're not saying we'll fix everything, but maybe we can make it a bit better.

## Current Status

We're literally at the "let's build something cool" stage. Like, we have:
- ðŸ“‹ A really detailed plan (thanks to way too much planning)
- ðŸ“‹ Tech stack decisions (after many late-night debates)
- ðŸ“‹ Team roles figured out
- ðŸ“‹ A lot of enthusiasm
- ðŸ“‹ Zero actual code (yet)

This is a few months long journey we're about to embark on. Stay tuned!

## Timeline (Rough Estimate)

- **Month 1**: Foundation & Core Features
- **Month 2**: AI/ML Integration & Testing
- **Month 3**: Advanced Features & Polish
- **Month 4**: Testing, Debugging, and Crying
- **Month 5**: Launch Prep & Documentation

*Subject to change based on how much we procrastinate*

## Getting Started (Eventually)

Once we actually have code to run, this section will be useful:

```bash
# This will work someday
git clone https://github.com/mindovermattress/skillbridge-india.git
cd skillbridge-india
# More instructions when we have something to install
```

## Contributing

We're just four friends building something we think is useful. If you want to help out or have ideas, feel free to:
- Open an issue
- Submit a PR
- Just message us

No formal process here - we're learning as we go.

## The Vision

We want to create a platform where:
- People can actually find jobs that match their skills
- Skill development is personalized and engaging
- Rural areas aren't left behind in the digital economy
- The whole hiring process is less painful for everyone

Ambitious? Maybe. Impossible? We'll find out.

## Contact

Find us probably debugging something at 2 AM or message the team:
- **Project Lead**: Pranav Rana
- **Email**: [we should probably add this]
- **Discord**: [our server link when we make one]

*Built with â˜•, late nights, and the naive optimism of university students*
